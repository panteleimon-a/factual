# FACTUAL Logo Placeholder

This directory should contain the FACTUAL logo file: `factual_logo_f_only.png`

The logo should be a high-contrast "F" mark that matches the dark, edgy aesthetic of the landing page.

If the logo file is not present, the landing page will still render correctly as it's designed to gracefully handle missing images.

## Recommended specifications:
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Size: 400x400px or similar square format
- Style: Bold "F" character with gradient from white to accent green (#00ff88)
- Background: Transparent

The HTML page includes fallback behavior to hide the image element if the file is not found.
